# The Chronicle of Light

An interactive web application for exploring Islamic history through a
time-axis timeline, a geolocated map of events, and a 3-D force-directed
graph of connections between them. The dataset lives as one JSON file per
event under `src/data/events/`; a Wikipedia/Wikidata importer is included
for bulk-seeding drafts that humans then review and promote.

> **Status:** pre-launch / private. License files (MIT for code, CC BY-SA
> 4.0 for the dataset) are in place; CI is green; the public-release plan
> is in `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-05-15-open-source-launch-plan.md`.

## What's here

**UI features (already working on `main`)**

- **Time-axis timeline** with a continuous dashed rail, teal century
  markers (`Earlier`, `600`, `700`, …, `2000`), and a top bar with a
  small red arrow indicator under the active era. Cards are positioned
  along the X axis by their `startDate` (so closer-in-time events sit
  visually closer); top/bottom lanes are assigned only to avoid overlap.
  Card shapes are deterministically randomized per `id` for visual
  variety.
- **Inline detail panel** with a full-bleed two-column NMA-style layout
  (hero image + caption left, date / teal headline / body / disabled
  *Read more* CTA right). Closes on `Escape` or the circular `×`.
- **Interactive map** using CARTO Voyager tiles (English place labels
  worldwide, no API key). Markers are uniform teal — no per-category
  colour palette.
- **3-D Event Connections graph** rendered by `react-force-graph-3d`
  (Three.js + WebGL): force-directed sphere of nodes, category-coloured
  spheres sized by connection degree, animated link particles, sprite
  text labels that fade in as the camera approaches a node, click-to-fly
  camera focus.
- **Filter bar** (category, region, date range) and an "All moments" card
  grid below the stage.

**Tooling**

- JSON Schema (`src/data/event.schema.json`) validated against every
  event in CI.
- Cross-reference validator that asserts every `connections[]` ID
  resolves to an existing event.
- Wikipedia → events importer with optional `--depth` recursion through
  the Wikipedia link graph.
- ESLint flat config, TypeScript strict mode, GitHub Actions CI.

## Tech stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Build / dev server | **Vite 5** + **TypeScript 5** |
| UI | **React 18** functional components + hooks |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS 3** (Public Sans typeface) |
| 3-D graph | **react-force-graph-3d** on **Three.js**, with **three-spritetext** for in-scene labels |
| Map | **react-leaflet 4** on **Leaflet 1.9**, CARTO Voyager tiles |
| Timeline | bespoke CSS scroller (NMA-style; replaced an earlier vis-timeline restyle) |
| Linting | **ESLint 10** flat config (`eslint.config.js`) |
| Schema validation | **ajv** + **ajv-formats**, run from a Node script |
| CI | GitHub Actions: lint, build, validate-events |

No backend yet. The app is a static SPA — events are bundled into the
JS at build time via Vite's `import.meta.glob`.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Prerequisites
#    Node.js 20+ (anything ≥ 18 will probably work; CI uses 20)
#    npm (the project commits package-lock.json)

# 2. Clone and install
git clone git@github.com:rafsunsheikh/The-Chronicle-of-Light.git
cd The-Chronicle-of-Light
npm install

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev
#    → opens http://localhost:5173 (or 5174 if 5173 is busy)
#    Hot reload picks up edits in src/

# 4. Sanity-check before committing
npm run lint
npm run validate:events
npm run build
```

That's the whole flow for code or content work — there's no database,
no env var setup, and no auth.

## Available npm scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with hot reload. |
| `npm run build` | `tsc && vite build`. Type-checks then bundles to `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the `dist/` build locally. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over `src/`. CI runs the same command. |
| `npm run validate:events` | Checks every JSON file in `src/data/events/` against the schema, asserts unique IDs, filename ↔ id alignment, year-of-id ↔ year-of-startDate match, and that every `connections[]` ID resolves to a real event. |
| `npm run import:wikipedia` | Run the Wikipedia importer. See `scripts/wikipedia-import/README.md`. |

## The data model

Every event lives in **one file per event** at
`src/data/events/{id}.json`. The runtime loads them with Vite's
`import.meta.glob`, sorts numerically by `startDate`, and feeds them to
the components. There is no database.

### Schema

The authoritative shape is `src/data/event.schema.json` (JSON Schema
Draft 2020-12). The TypeScript type in `src/types/incident.ts` mirrors
it. Required fields:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "event-0624-battle-of-badr",
  "title": "Battle of Badr",
  "description": "First major military victory for Muslims against the Quraysh of Mecca.",
  "startDate": "0624-03-13",
  "endDate": "0624-03-13",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 26.5933,
    "longitude": 39.0267,
    "name": "Badr, Saudi Arabia"
  },
  "category": "military",
  "connections": ["event-0622-hijra-migration-to-medina"]
}
```

Optional fields the schema accepts:

- `learningPath`, `dynasty`, `region`
- `media[]` — image / video / document URLs
- `sources[]` — provenance records (citation, url, page, wikidata QID,
  retrieved date, license). Required when `confidence` is
  `"auto-imported"` or `"contested"`.
- `confidence` — `established` | `contested` | `legendary` |
  `auto-imported`. Importer-written events ship as `auto-imported`;
  reviewers flip to `established`.
- `perspectives[]` — `sunni` | `shia` | `ibadi` | `academic` | `secular`.
  Required when `confidence` is `contested`.

### Naming convention

- `id` is `event-YYYY-slug` (4-digit zero-padded start year + a
  hyphen-lowercase slug derived from the title).
- The filename is exactly `{id}.json` — id ↔ filename ↔ filename's year
  prefix ↔ startDate's year prefix are all enforced by the validator.
- Years are **always 4-digit zero-padded** (e.g., `0624-03-13` not
  `624-3-13`). This makes filename alphabetical sort match chronological
  sort, and avoids the lexicographic ordering bug that comes from
  mixing 3-digit and 4-digit year strings.

## Adding or editing an event

The workflow is **PR-driven**; there is no UI for content editing.

**To add an event:**

1. Pick a stable `id`: `event-YYYY-some-slug` (4-digit year + slug).
2. Create `src/data/events/{id}.json` containing the fields above.
3. Run `npm run validate:events` locally — it should report `✓ N
   event(s) validated, connections intact`. If it complains, fix what
   it says and re-run.
4. (Optional) `npm run dev` and verify the card shows up on the
   timeline / map / 3-D graph.
5. Open a PR. CI runs lint + build + validate-events.

**To edit an event:**

1. Edit the JSON file directly. Don't rename it unless you're also
   updating `id`, `startDate`'s year, and every `connections[]`
   reference that points to the old id.
2. Run `npm run validate:events`.
3. PR.

**To delete an event:**

1. Delete the file.
2. Grep for the id in other files' `connections[]` and remove those
   references. The validator will fail if any orphan references remain.
3. PR.

## The Wikipedia importer

For bulk seeding, `scripts/wikipedia-import/` walks the Wikipedia link
graph from a seed article, batch-resolves each linked article to a
Wikidata QID, runs one SPARQL query to filter down to QIDs that have
both a date and coordinates, then fetches Wikipedia REST summaries only
for the survivors. Drafts are written to `src/data/events/imported/`
(gitignored) with `confidence: "auto-imported"`.

Quick start:

```bash
export IMPORTER_USER_AGENT='The-Chronicle-of-Light-Importer/0.1 (https://github.com/rafsunsheikh/The-Chronicle-of-Light; your-email@example.com)'

# dry-run on the default seed at depth 1
npm run import:wikipedia -- --depth 1 --max 20 --dry-run

# real run when the dry-run output looks reasonable
npm run import:wikipedia -- --depth 1 --max 20
```

Then review the drafts (delete obvious false positives, fix
mis-categorized events, fill in `connections[]`, flip `confidence` to
`established`) and move the keepers from `src/data/events/imported/`
to `src/data/events/`. Open a PR with batches of ~10 promoted events at
a time.

**Full documentation** including all flags, recursion behaviour,
caching, politeness checklist, and the review workflow:
[`scripts/wikipedia-import/README.md`](scripts/wikipedia-import/README.md).

## Architecture notes

A few things that aren't obvious from the file tree:

**`useIncidents` is the single data entry point.** Vite globs every
`src/data/events/*.json` at build time and bundles the contents into
the JS chunk. The hook sorts numerically by `startDate`, exposes
filtered + unfiltered lists, and holds filter state (category, region,
date range, selected era). All visualisation components read from this
one source.

**Timeline placement is data-driven.** `TimelineView.tsx::placeEra`
sorts events chronologically, then greedily walks them left-to-right,
computing each card's `idealX = (year − firstYearInEra) × PX_PER_YEAR`
and assigning whichever lane (top / bottom) lets the card sit nearest
its ideal X without overlapping the previous card in that lane.
Constants at the top of the file (`PX_PER_YEAR`, `LANE_GAP`,
`ERA_RIGHT_BUFFER`) tune visual density. Card shapes are picked
deterministically from a hash of `id` so they don't shuffle on rerender.

**The 3-D graph uses two layers per node**: the base sphere from
`react-force-graph-3d` (sized by `connections.length`), plus a
`SpriteText` label child added via `nodeThreeObjectExtend`. A
`controls.change` listener plus a per-frame polling interval show or
hide each label based on its distance to the camera, so labels appear
as you zoom in and disappear when you zoom out.

**The map renders CARTO Voyager tiles** (`{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/
rastertiles/voyager/...`) instead of vanilla OpenStreetMap so place
names are in English worldwide. No API key required. Markers are plain
teal divIcons; the per-category colour palette was removed when the
project moved to the NMA palette.

**CI is three Actions jobs** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `lint`,
`build`, and `validate-events`, all on `pull_request` and pushes to
`main`. Each installs deps via `npm ci` with the Node 20 cache, runs
the corresponding npm script, and fails the PR on any non-zero exit.

## Contributing

This project will go open-source in the near future. The detailed
launch plan lives at
`thoughts/shared/plans/2026-05-15-open-source-launch-plan.md`. Until
then:

- The dataset is the asset and the contribution surface — most PRs will
  be event additions, corrections, or `connections[]` enrichment.
- Code PRs: keep them focused. Run lint, build, and validate-events
  before pushing.
- For Islamic-history content: future PRs are expected to cite a
  `sources[]` entry. Contested events should set `confidence:
  "contested"` and list the relevant `perspectives[]` (sunni / shia /
  academic / …).

`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` are not yet checked in — they're on the
pre-launch checklist in the OSS launch plan.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs three jobs in parallel on every push to `main` and
every PR:

| Job | What it does | Failing means |
|---|---|---|
| `lint` | `npm run lint` (ESLint 10 over `src/`) | code quality / TS issue |
| `build` | `npm run build` (`tsc && vite build`) | type error or bundler error |
| `validate-events` | `npm run validate:events` | a JSON file in `src/data/events/` doesn't match the schema, or a `connections[]` reference is dangling |

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. All three must be green
before merge.

## Licensing

This project uses **dual licensing**:

- **Code** (everything except `src/data/`) → **MIT** (`LICENSE`)
- **Dataset** (`src/data/events/*.json` and the schema) → **Creative
  Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0** (`LICENSE-DATA`)

CC BY-SA 4.0 was chosen for the dataset because it matches the license
on Wikipedia content — events imported via `scripts/wikipedia-import/`
record their Wikipedia URL in `sources[]`, satisfying the attribution
requirement. Anyone reusing the dataset must continue to ShareAlike.

## Where to find more context

If something in the codebase looks odd, the planning / research notes
in `thoughts/` usually explain why:

- `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-05-15-open-source-launch-plan.md` — full
  pre-public-release checklist and rationale.
- `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-05-15-nma-defining-moments-timeline-implementation.md`
  — phase-by-phase plan for the timeline redesign (NMA-style layout,
  randomized cards, red era indicator).
- `thoughts/shared/research/2026-05-15-nma-defining-moments-timeline-visual-replication.md`
  — visual reference research and design decisions.
- `scripts/wikipedia-import/README.md` — flag reference, recursion
  semantics, suggested seed pages, review workflow.

For per-component design rationale (e.g., why timeline X positions are
computed instead of grid-based, why the 3-D graph uses Sprite labels
instead of HTML), check the comments at the top of the relevant file —
non-obvious decisions are documented inline.
